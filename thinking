Here we take notes and think about new functionality

protocole : %{mac : str, port : int}

Today(24-10-2023) -> How do switches really operates
- notes device mac in table  <- for identification
- portsize !!
- incoming packets contain a header -> contain receiver mac (routing)
- consider having bandwidth included
- unmanaged switch -> the one we will build now
- managed switch -> smtp <- see protocol, IP routing, 
 
  => features
  	- enable/disable ports  -> done
	- connect devices on ports -> store macs -> done
	- dispatch devices from ports -> done
	- portsize -> done
	- mac storage -> done
	- monitoring -> future
	- mac filtering -> future

Future(soon) -> hubs -> stall because we do device now
- broadcast to all connected devices


TODAY(29-10-2023) -> what do we want to do with devices
tb connect to anything
- retrieve mac
- list connected x
- retrieve open connection possibilities

  => features
  	- holds state %{mac: str, connections: [%{mac: str, port: int}]} -it does
	- list connections -> ongoing 
	- retrieve connections (pubsub)


Tomorrow(30-10-2023) -> Connection
- defstruct [:uuid, :mac, :port]
- establish
- dispatch
-
