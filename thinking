Here we take notes and think about new functionality

Today(24-10-2023) -> How do switches really operates
- notes device mac in table  <- for identification
- portsize !!
- incoming packets contain a header -> contain receiver mac (routing)
- consider having bandwidth included
- unmanaged switch -> the one we will build now
- managed switch -> smtp <- see protocol, IP routing, 
 
  => features
  	- enable/disable ports  -> done
	- connect devices on ports -> store macs -> done
	- dispatch devices from ports -> ongoing
	- portsize -> done
	- mac storage -> done
	- monitoring -> future
	- mac filtering -> future
 




Future(soon) -> hubs
- broadcast to all connected devices
